The AI engineer successfully guided the MathMint Quiz application from a foundational MVP to a more mature, decentralized Web3 experience. Key initial achievements included developing a functional  with optional MetaMask wallet connection and core quiz logic. Significant effort was dedicated to creating comprehensive documentation for Web3.Storage deployment and free DNS setup. A major focus was enhancing user onboarding and safety, culminating in a Bank of Good Times themed experience with friendly language and security guides. Critical bug fixes involved correcting the smart contract ABI and function calls ( vs. ), resolving gas estimation issues, and improving network detection. UI refinements, such as scrollable leaderboards and prominent MUSD swap links, were also implemented. The work recently evolved to creating a simplified  and is currently in the process of building an entirely new tabbed UI () to further streamline user interaction and data presentation, reflecting a continuous iteration towards a user-centric and robust application.

<product_requirements>
The MathMint Quiz is a Web3 application on Mezo’s Bitcoin L2, designed to teach times-tables and introduce digital collectibles (NFTs). Users connect a Bitcoin-compatible wallet (Unisat/Leather/MetaMask), answer 5 random times-table questions, earning +10 points for correct answers and -1 for incorrect (minimum 0). Points are saved on-chain. Upon reaching 50 points, users can mint an ERC-721 NFT (MathMint Badge) on Mezo testnet, with metadata on IPFS. A leaderboard displays the top 5 scores from on-chain data. The UI should be simple, colorful, retro arcade-themed, and mobile-responsive.

Later requirements included:
- Instructions for contract deployment and testing.
- MUSD boost: Stake 1 MUSD for a 1.5x point multiplier (15 points per correct answer).
- Quiz integration into the demo page with interactive gameplay, timer, multiple-choice, feedback, and progress.
- Wallet connection to be optional, allowing users to play before connecting, with prompts for on-chain actions.
- Online safety, privacy, and security tips for self-custody, framed as Your Own Bank Of Good Times.
- Creation of a simplified demo page ().
- A new UI with 2 tabs: Quiz (quiz, MUSD hint, save points, leaderboard) and Bank (wallet connect/create, display tBTC/MUSD/points/NFTs, eligibility, mint option) with automatic data fetching.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for QuizContract and MathMintNFT.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for contract compilation, testing, and deployment.
- **Mezo Bitcoin L2**: The blockchain network for on-chain transactions and NFT minting.
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js**: Libraries for wallet integration and contract interaction (MetaMask).
- **IPFS/Web3.Storage**: Decentralized storage for NFT metadata and frontend hosting.
- **MUSD**: Mezo's native stablecoin, used for boosting quiz scores.

<code_architecture>
The application's core architecture evolved from an initial React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup to a fully decentralized model centered around Solidity smart contracts on Mezo L2 and a static HTML/JavaScript frontend for client-side interaction.

**Key Files and Recent Changes:**
- ****:
    - Wallet connection made optional with comprehensive checks for blockchain interactions.
    - UI reordered to prioritize the quiz over wallet connection, improving user flow.
    - Integrated welcome modal, security tips, and tooltips with a Bank of Good Times theme.
    - Text was updated for a newbie-friendly tone (e.g., Mint Badges, Own A Bank Account On Mezo).
    - The  ABI and function calls were corrected to use  (after a previous error of incorrectly changing to ).
    - MUSD boost logic was refined to prevent gas estimation errors, and a prominent MUSD swap link was added.
    - Leaderboard display was modified to expand rather than scroll.
    - Faucet and MUSD swap URLs were updated to current Mezo testnet addresses.
- ****: This file was created as a simplified version of  and has received identical updates and fixes as  to maintain consistency and address issues.
- ****: This file has been newly created in response to the latest user request for a tabbed UI, and its implementation is currently underway.
- **Documentation**: A significant number of new markdown files were generated (, , , , etc.) to provide detailed guides and project overview.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of the new tabbed UI in .
- Implement Phase 2: Rebuilding the full React frontend with Web3 integration for a fully decentralized application.
- Implement Phase 3: Optimizing the application (gas, error handling, MetaMask prompts) and potentially deploying the frontend to IPFS.
- Research and integrate Bitcoin wallet support (Unisat/Leather) as a future enhancement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in creating a new user interface for the MathMint Quiz application. The user explicitly requested a simplified UI structured into two distinct tabs: a Quiz tab and a Bank tab. The Quiz tab is intended to house the main quiz gameplay, a hint for the MUSD boost feature, the option to save points to the on-chain bank, and the leaderboard. The Bank tab will focus on wallet management, offering options to connect an existing wallet or guide users through creating a new one. It will also display the user's current holdings of tBTC, MUSD, saved quiz points, any held NFTs, NFT eligibility, and the option to mint new NFTs. A crucial aspect of this new design is the automatic fetching of all read-only data (like leaderboard entries and wallet contents) without requiring manual button clicks. The engineer has successfully created the initial file for this new UI at .
